# react-todo
A React todo-list app using The Net Ninja and Brad Traversy tutorials.

I have included a basic version using state for storage as well as an additional version using MongoDB for the backend.

First run 'npm install' in the root directory for backend dependencies, then cd into the client folder and run 'yarn install' (or 'npm install') for react dependencies.

To start, run 'node server' and 'yarn start' in their respective directories.
